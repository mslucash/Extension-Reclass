# What is the Biomass Reclassification Output Extension?

This extension summarizes output from any biomass-compatible extensions, including NECN, PnET, and Biomass Succession. The Biomass Reclassification Output extension reclassifies sites into forest types dependent upon species dominance at that site. Dominance is determined by total biomass per species at the site.
